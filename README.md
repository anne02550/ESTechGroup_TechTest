# ESTechGroup TechTest
My solution to the ES Tech Group interview technical test

## How to run
0. Ensure you have nodejs installed
1. Clone the repository
2. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory and run `npm install`
3. You should now be able to run `node insert.js` to insert the csv data into your database or `node getPrice.js` to fetch the prices and sku for given products.

NOTES: 
* You may need to change the database credentials stored in database.js to fit your local setup as they were hard coded to save time.
* `getPrices.js` currently fetches prices for 2 hardcoded products and 1 hardcoded account. Given more time I would have liked to create a better user interface for this (maybe a web app).
